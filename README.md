Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves examining datasets to understand structure, detect missing values, spot outliers, assess feature distributions, explore relationships, and test assumptions for modeling.
It can be:

Univariate – studying a single variable’s distribution and spread.

Bivariate – analyzing relationships between two variables via plots and correlations.

Multivariate – exploring interactions among multiple variables using techniques like pair plots, 3D plots, and PCA.
