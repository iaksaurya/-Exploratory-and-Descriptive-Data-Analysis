Project Name: Exploratory and Descriptive Data Analysis
Course Name :Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves examining datasets to understand structure, detect missing values, spot outliers, assess feature distributions, explore relationships, and test assumptions for modeling.
It can be:

Univariate – studying a single variable’s distribution and spread.

Bivariate – analyzing relationships between two variables via plots and correlations.

Multivariate – exploring interactions among multiple variables using techniques like pair plots, 3D plots, and PCA.
